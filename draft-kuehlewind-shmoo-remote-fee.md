--- abstract

This document proposes a principle for open participation that extends the open process
principle as defined in RFC3935 stating that there must always be a free option for online participation to IETF meeting over the Internet.

# Introduction

Remote participation for IETF in-person meetings has evolved over time from email only
to live chat and audio streaming up to a full online meeting system that is tightly integrated
into the in-room session and enables interactive participation by audio and video.
Based on this evolution online participation has historically been free for remote attendees.

Given this more full-blown participation option, the IETF observed an increasing number
of remote participants in the recents year. This increase can be explained by the ease by which
new participants can join a meeting or only attend selected parts of the meeting agenda, and also by 
a less strongly perceived need to attend every meeting in person, either due to financial
reasons or other circumstances. In order to better understand
these trends the IETF started requiring registration as "participant" (in contrast to 
an "observer") for remote participation, still without any registration fee applied.

With the recent move to full online meetings, however, there is no distinction between
remote and other participants anymore which lead to the introduction of a meeting fee
for all participants, removing the free remote option.

This change lead to concerns about the impact both on those who
regularly remotely attend meetings, as well as people looking to
attend IETF meetings for thhe first time.  In both cases, even a small
registration fee can be a barrier to participation.

# Principle of open participation

This documents outlines the principle of open participation and solicits community feedback in
order to reach consensus on this or a similar principle that the IETF LLC can use to guide future
decision about registration fees for full online meetings.

The principle this document states is simple: there must always be an option for free
participation to IETF meeting over the Internet.

This principle aims to support the openness principle of the IETF as defined in {{!RFC3935}}:

"Open process - any interested person can participate in the work,
   know what is being decided, and make his or her voice heard on the
   issue.  Part of this principle is our commitment to making our
   documents, our WG mailing lists, our attendance lists, and our
   meeting minutes publicly available on the Internet."
   
While the principle in RFC3935 is explicitly noting that this principle includes a requirement to open 
basically all our documents and documentation and making it accessible over the Internet, it was 
probably written with mainly having mailing interactions in mind when talking about participation.

This document extends this principle but explicitly covering online participation at meetings. As
such when a meeting is run only online, there must be a free option to participant without any
restrictions to the way of participating.

# Financial impact

Online meetings have lower costs than in-person meeting, however, they are not for free, nor are
any services that the IETF provides for other online interactions, such as mailing lists, document access over the datatracker or other online platforms, or Webex accounts for working groups and 
other roles in the IETF.

These and other running costs of the IETF are also cross-financed by income generated through
meeting fees. The intention of this document and the principle stated herein is not to make participation
free for everyone but to always have a free option that can be used without any barriers other than
the registration procedure itself.

It is not in scope for this document or the shmoo working group to make suggestions for changing
the IETF's overall funding model. This is the responsibility of the LLC Board taking agreed principles
like the one proposed in this document into account.
